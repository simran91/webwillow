WebWillow is a program that can scoot around a given website like a robot
looking for files that might match a particular pattern (specified 
by you) and then outputting its results into a html file based on
a template. 

If you're a person that checks out particular pages or sections of a website
on a routine basis (as the website might contain dynamic content) then
you might find it useful, as you won't have to check out various 
sections on the various websites you like, WebWillow can go around,
collect the info, and present it in a summarised format (again, based
on the template you specify) and then you can see if you really want
to view the real page and click thru! 

This program had been written just for personal use, but is made public with
the assumption that others too may find it useful :-)
